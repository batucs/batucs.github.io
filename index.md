### CPSC 120


* Lab 6


    Lab 6 was important for my introduction to C++. I've come to known that vectors are something that is vital for a programming and make many tasks possible or the existing ones easier. Both parts helped me understand how vectors work. Since we had only used strings, doubles and integers up until that point, it was crucial for my improvement.




* Lab 7


    Lab 7 was very interesting to me because it was the first time I realized how the practice of C++ can be integrated to our lives. A game like blackjack was a good choice because it has the perfect balance of educational code potential and ease of understanding considering I'm still new to coding, and a language like C++ can be hard.




* Lab 8


    Lab 8 was very intriguing. This was the first time I realized how code can be written differently but execute the same way. I thought of a different way of doing loops in class but then realized that if the process was 10000 lines instead of 21, my code would have taken too much effort and unnecessary space, so I improved on my syntax and made my code cleaner.
